# Description
# Tools used
- ASP.NET Core for a very basic back-end server.
- JQuery/Bootstrap/HTML/KendoUI
# Workflow
- The back-end code acts as an API by reading data from a json file and transfering it over to an endpoint.
- The front-end code fetches the data provided from the server and with the help of KendoUI templates, dynamically displays the products.
- Custom front-end files can be located in the wwwroot folder - index.html, css/custom.css, js/products.js. The rest of the contents of the folder include libraries.
